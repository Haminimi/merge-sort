## Reflection and resources
In the previous lessons, the main topics were recursion and algorithms, and I found them very fascinating and extremely interesting to work with.

- [This lecture by CS50](https://youtu.be/4oqjcKenCH8?t=6248) provides an excellent conceptual presentation of the Merge Sort algorithm. 

- [This visualizer](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/sorting/merge-sort/visualize/) is great for visualizing how the Merge Sort and other algorithms work step by step.
